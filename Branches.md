## Learning to use branches
- create and switch to new branch using 'git checkout -b name'
- to be able to use the branch use 'git push --set-upstream origin test_branch"
- create changes and push like usual
- to switch to an already existing branch use 'git checkout name'
- to revert to main branch use 'git push --set-upstream origin main"
