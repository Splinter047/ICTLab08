## Learning to use branches
- create and switch to new branch using 'git checkout -b name'"
- create changes and push like usual
- to push to the new branch use 'git push origin -u test_branch"
- to switch to an already existing branch use 'git checkout name'
- to change default branch use 'git push --set-upstream origin main"
